                <p class="para_for_project1">An asset management system that is used to log, tack and organise assets of all types. From apps and games, software and other virtual assets to computers, servers, printers and any other physical asset, this system works with it all to track and organise so you don’t have to. In the report section you can report on anything from assets already stored in the table, to logging important documents so they are all in one tidy place.<br/><br/> This system was created using HTML, CSS and JS for the web design and python for the majority of the backend. The framework Flask was used alongside JSON for the database.</p>

                <p class="para_for_project2">This was one of my most enjoyable projects I’ve worked on. This guitar tuner was coded using entirely Python by utilising the TKInter module for the UI and front end design. The guitar tuner works by taking sound as an input and adding the average pitch to an array over a few micro seconds. The data is the passed through a Fourier Transformation in order to calculate the frequency which can then be determined as too low or too high.<br/><br/>This project taught me a lot about data as extensive data analytics and manipulation was required, as well as getting to use and learning more about modules such as Matplotlib and Numpy.</p>

                <p class="para_for_project2">A modern replica of the old classic battleships. with single and multiplayer modes, you can enjoy a game with a friend, or just play by yourself. This project was made in Android Studio using Kotlin alongside Gradle build automation.<br/><br/>This project was amazing for learning more about Kotlin as well as how Android Stdio works. I particularly enjoyed the UI development as designing Battleships provides the ability to use a retro design to reminisce on the original, or go with a more modern day spin on the classic.</p>
